Regular expressions, more commonly known as regex, is a powerful way of describing patterns in strings.

It can be pretty complicated, so I wrote this quick guide as a form of note-taking while learning about regex myself.

## Usage in JavaScript
```javascript
// Instantiating a new regular expression
let regex = /123/;
let regexAlt = new RegExp('xyz');

// Testing for matches
regex.test('01234'); // -> true
regexAlt.test('abcxyzdef'); // -> true

// Extracting matches
regex.match('01234'); // -> ['123']
regexAlt.match('abcxyzdef'); // -> ['xyz']
```

## Characters
These special characters match specific character groups when used in a regular expression.

| Character | Description                                                   |
| --------- | ------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `\d`      | A digit character (0 - 9)                                     |
| `\w`      | A word character (alphanumeric)                               |
| `\s`      | A whitespace character (space, tab, newline, carriage return) |
| `\D`      | A non-digit character                                         |
| `\W`      | A non-word character                                          |
| `\S`      | A non-whitespace character                                    |

As illustrated, the uppercase counterparts of each special character have opposite meanings to the lowercase characters.

An example use would be expressing one's birth date in the format `DD-MMM-YYYY`:
```javascript
// A regular expression for matching a birth date
let regex = /\d\d-\w\w\w-\d\d\d\d/;
regex.test('01-Apr-1993'); // -> true
```

## Quantifiers
Repeating multiple special characters is pretty tedious. Thankfully, regex offers quantifiers as pattern _suffixes_ to specify how many times a pattern should be matched.

 | Quantifier | Description                                |
 | ---------- | ------------------------------------------ |
 | `+`        | One or more patterns                       |
 | `*`        | Zero or more patterns                      |
 | `{2}`      | Exactly twice                              |
 | `{2,5}`    | Any number of times from 2 to 5, inclusive |
 | `{2,}`     | 2 or more times                            |
 | `?`        | Zero or one pattern (meaning optional)     |

 We can now simplify the regexp for a birth date as such:
```javascript
let regex = /\d{1,2}-\w{3}-\d{4}/;
regex.test('01-Apr-1993'); // -> true
regex.test('1-Apr-1993'); // -> true
```
 ## Character Classes
Suppose we want to match _any one_ of multiple patterns in a string. Character classes help with this.

| Expression     | Description                     |
| -------------- | ------------------------------- |
| `[0123456789]` | Any digit from 0 to 9           |
| `[0-9]`        | Any digit from 0 to 9           |
| `[abcde]`      | Any alphabet from a to e        |
| `[a-e]`        | Any alphabet from a to e        |
| `[^0-9]`       | Any character that isn't 0 to 9 |
| `[^a-e]`       | Any character that isn't a to e |
