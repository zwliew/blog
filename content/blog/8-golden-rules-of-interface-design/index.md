Shneiderman devised 8 rules of interface design. Elements of these rules can be found in many modern interfaces used today.

## The Rules
| Rule                                   | Description                                                                                      |
| -------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| Strive for consistency                 | Things should work according to convention; similar actions and controls are presented similarly |
| Enable frequent users to use shortcuts | Allow quicker and simpler access to frequently used features/actions                             |
| Offer informative feedback             | Keep the user in the know of what is going on in the system; acknowledge users' actions          |
| Permit easy reversal of actions        | Allow users to undo mistakes, encouraging them to explore the interface more freely              |
| Handle errors simply                   | Detect errors and offer the user simple ways to handle them                                      |
| Design dialog to yield closure         | Group sequences of actions and offer feedback when each group has been completed                 |
| Support internal locus of control      | Make users the initiators of action, giving them the sense of being in control                   |
| Reduce short-term memory load          | Keep things simple to avoid overloading the user with too much information                       |

## Food for thought
Think of various commercial products today. The Windows OS, the Google Assistant, and the iPhone are a few examples. Can you think of various aspects of these products' interfaces that follow the 8 rules of interface design?
