Hi, I'm Zhao Wei Liew. Zhao Wei is my first name, and Liew is my last. I've recently graduated from high school and am awaiting undergraduate studies.

I'm constantly looking for new things to learn and to add to my toolset for building products. As of writing this post, I'm interested in competitive programming and frontend web development.

This blog is where I intend to pen down any notes and thoughts I have at certain points in time.

Hope you enjoy it!
